    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objective:\n",
    "    - Gain a fundamental understanding of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.\n",
    "    - Develop hands-on experience with sequence data processing and text generation in PyTorch. Given the simplicity of the model, amount of data, and computer resources, the text you generate will not replace ChatGPT, and results must likely will not make a lot of sense. Its only purpose is academic and to understand the text generation using RNNs.\n",
    "    - Enhance code comprehension and documentation skills by commenting on provided starter code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instructions:\n",
    "    - Code Understanding: Begin by thoroughly reading and understanding the code. Comment each section/block of the provided code to demonstrate your understanding. For this, you are encouraged to add cells with experiments to improve your understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Model Overview: The starter code includes an LSTM model setup for sequence data processing. Familiarize yourself with the model architecture and its components. Once you are familiar with the provided model, feel free to change the model to experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Training Function: Implement a function to train the LSTM model on the WikiText-2 dataset. This function should feed the training data into the model and perform backpropagation. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Text Generation Function: Create a function that accepts starting text (seed text) and a specified total number of words to generate. The function should use the trained model to generate a continuation of the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Code Commenting: Ensure that all the provided starter code is well-commented. Explain the purpose and functionality of each section, indicating your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Submission: Submit your Jupyter Notebook with all sections completed and commented. Include a markdown cell with the full names of all contributing team members at the beginning of the notebook.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluation Criteria:\n",
    "    - Code Commenting (60%): The clarity, accuracy, and thoroughness of comments explaining the provided code. You are suggested to use markdown cells for your explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Training Function Implementation (20%): The correct implementation of the training function, which should effectively train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Text Generation Functionality (10%): A working function is provided in comments. You are free to use it as long as you make sure to uderstand it, you may as well improve it as you see fit. The minimum expected is to provide comments for the given function. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Conclusions (10%): Provide some final remarks specifying the differences you notice between this model and the one used  for classification tasks. Also comment on changes you made to the model, hyperparameters, and any other information you consider relevant. Also, please provide 3 examples of generated texts.\n",
